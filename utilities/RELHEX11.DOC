AUDIENCE:

People who have M80 or RMAC but who do not have MAC


FUNCTION:

Converts a .REL file to a .HEX file without filling in
unspecified regions with 0's (as L80 does).  Thus the .HEX file
may be used as a patch overlay file in conjunction with DDT.


ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER PUBLIC DOMAIN VERSION:

     There is another public domain version of RELHEX which is
based upon READREL.  This version has the following advantages
over that one:

1.  Works in conjunction with RMAC.  The other version fails
when RMAC declares a program (CSEG) size, even though the
declared size is zero.  Note that M80 does not declare a program
(CSEG) size if the size is zero.

2.  Much smaller than the other version.

3.  Much faster than the other version.


RESTRICTIONS:

1.  An ASEG directive must be placed in the source file before
the first ORG directive.  If there is no ORG then place the ASEG
before the first code-generating instruction.

2. RELHEX is not a linker.  All code and data in the source file
must be in ASEG and there may not be any PUBLIC or EXTERN
directives.
