This repository contains a snapshot of the original software, plus
my versions of modified source files and new utilities for Bill Shen's

The original software is located in zip files in the "original" subdirectory.

My own modifications to the software are in the "system" subdirectory and

New Utilities are in the "utilities" subdirectory.

As at 18-Jul-2018, only an updated Non-Banked CBIOS and a CP/M utility

that have been patched for Y2K and other updates.
